                <h1>Women with Baskets, Fish and Crab</h1>
                <p>Women with Baskets, Fish, and Crab was among the favorite paintings of the artist, Anita Magsaysay-Ho, displayed
                    prominently in her living room before finding a home with one of her oldest friends. The piece melds together a
                    celebration of Filipino craft, the strength of Filipina women, and the talent and technique of one of the country’s most
                    celebrated painters. The baskets depicted invoke the industriousness and dedication involved in basket weaving—a
                    practice Anita considered among the most beautiful of Filipino handicrafts. A similar level of mastery and precision was
                    needed to portray these objects. Anita later related that she found the process challenging, with careful work needed to
                    convey the curvature and to capture the interplay of shadows and of light.
